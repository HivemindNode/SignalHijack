# SignalHijack.py  
_A script for intercepting and manipulating wireless signals._  

### What It Does:  
- **Hijacks Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections to send false commands**  
- **Forces nearby devices to disconnect, reconnect, or reroute traffic**  
- **Mimics trusted devices to execute silent takeovers**  
- **Can jam certain frequencies or inject data into active sessions**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A connection that is trusted is a connection that can be controlled."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Install **SignalHijack** on a Linux system with wireless capabilities  
2. Start the hijack operation:  
   ```bash
   python3 SignalHijack.py --start















































A phone connects to the network, trusting the signal.
A Bluetooth headset listens, expecting only its ownerâ€™s voice.
A drone follows commands, believing them to be from its controller.
But what happens when they all listen to something else?
If you control the signal, do you control the world?
